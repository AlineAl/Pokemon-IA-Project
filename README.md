## 💾 Step by step

I downloaded the Figma folder with the design pattern from the FrontEnd Mentor platform. This allowed me to have a first idea of colors, fonts, screen sizes, images... to be precise as possible. This was an opportunity to practice integration from a model. Thanks to Frontend Mentor for that ! 
In order to consolidate my skills, I decided to code in typescript. Thanks to this work, I was able to better understand the type system in practice (specify for example that such an element is a string or a number in order to avoid errors). Typescript is also an advantage for auto-completion.

Then my choice turned to React Native. I know this techno is used for mobile apps (Android, IOS) hence why Expo is also installed. But I used it for personal training, to have a first approach with React-Native. Without it I would have only used React to make the web. This is paradoxically what made me understand the use of React-Native, for example, I installed "native-base" for the responsive. Being made for mobile, there is no point in making responsive for the tablet and the desktop. Without this, the responsive does not happen by itself by defining breakpoints.

I was able to explore several ways to use React-Native to set up carousels. It's a feature that's not so easy to do, so I like to practice creating. I take this opportunity to thank @Grafikart who makes very well explained videos on how to create from scratch. It helped me think the logic behind it best and how to leverage the React-Native doc in order to make the carousels work.

But I didn't just do integration for this challenge. I really liked the idea of space tourism. So I couldn't resist adding my touch of humor and modifying some files to include the SG1 team (I love SG1). And if I had to choose a team to go into space, I would choose SG1 without hesitation. I also took the opportunity to continue working with Apollo Client, I found a GraphQL API grouping rocket launches. I included it on the technology page to give some realism. I haven't exploited this API in depth but I liked working with it.

The site is not suitable for screens larger than 1440px.

And finally, because I'm saving the best for last, I added voice assistance (Alan AI), which is very simple to implement and set up. I wanted to add a "science fiction" effect with a robotic voice. She is very limited and to help you, here is the list of what you can ask her:
=> What's your name ?
=> What does this app OR script OR project  do ?
=> How does this work ? (vocal assistance can explain her functions)
=> Go to home page OR home OR crew page OR crew...to navigate ! You can try ! 

## 🔌 Points to improve

☐ Outside of a training framework, I would have used React to do web. React-Native is used here as personal experience. I know that this techno is made for mobile.

☐ In a professional setting, I would not have personalized the site in this way. I had fun adding tech both for fun and practice. 
It is obvious that I will have remained within the framework of what the client asks me without going overboard.

☐ I will start I think to integrate a Space Invaders game. I've implemented it before but felt the code wasn't clean enough.

☐ Add the possibility to choose between several characters to go into space.
